# Memory Game Project

Hi Dr. Liddle

This project was a lot of fun to put together. I followed a video tutorial on YouTube to create the to-do list page, so although I coded the whole thing, it is based on that tutorial. I then coded the memory game and the about page and all of the other functionality to complete the app. 

The game can be played by oneself or with up to 4 players.

The build and the netlify folders are for hosting and production builds via app.netlify.com

To play the game, go to https://stefans-memory-game.netlify.app

Enjoy!
Stefan
